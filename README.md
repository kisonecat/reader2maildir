# What is this?

reader2maildir downloads fresh items from your Google Reader account,
and places them into a local Maildir.  Seen marks are propagated both
ways, so if you read an article locally, it will be marked as read
remotely, and vice versa.

So by using reader2maildir, you can read your Google Reader items in
[Gnus](http://www.gnus.org/), and the seen marks will be synchronized.
